This project explores robust adaptive control strategies for multi-agent systems to address the challenges of achieving consensus and mitigating the effects of sensor uncertainties. We develop and analyze distributed control architectures tailored for time-invariant and time-varying uncertainties, ensuring stability and convergence under network topologies which has a spanning tree. By incorporating consensus protocols and adaptive estimation techniques, the proposed methods enhance the reliability and robustness of multi-agent systems. The theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating the efficacy of the approaches in real-world
